# claude-md-management

Update and improve CLAUDE.md files with learnings from coding sessions.

This skill helps you maintain and improve CLAUDE.md documentation by extracting learnings from coding sessions and updating documentation accordingly.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- You've completed a coding session and want to capture learnings
- CLAUDE.md files need updating with new context
- You want to improve future Claude sessions in a codebase
- Documentation is outdated or missing important context

## How It Works

1. **Reflect on the session** - Identify missing context that would help future sessions
2. **Find CLAUDE.md files** - Locate documentation files in the codebase
3. **Extract learnings** - Capture bash commands, code patterns, testing approaches, etc.
4. **Update documentation** - Add relevant context to CLAUDE.md files

## Key Learnings to Capture

- **Bash commands** that were used or discovered
- **Code style patterns** followed in the codebase
- **Testing approaches** that worked well
- **Environment/configuration quirks**
- **Warnings or gotchas** encountered
- **Project-specific conventions**

## Usage Example

```
# After a coding session, say:
"Update CLAUDE.md with learnings from this session"

# Or be specific:
"Add the bash commands we used to CLAUDE.md"
"Document the testing approach for this project"
```

## Implementation Notes

- Looks for CLAUDE.md and .claude.local.md files
- Respects existing documentation structure
- Adds context in appropriate sections
- Maintains readability and usefulness

## For Best Results

1. Use this skill at the end of coding sessions
2. Be specific about what learnings to capture
3. Review the updates before committing
4. Keep documentation concise and actionable
